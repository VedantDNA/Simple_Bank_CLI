# SimpleBankCLI

A simple command-line banking application built in Java.

## Description
This project is a beginner-friendly CLI bank app where users can create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance — all from the terminal. It demonstrates fundamental Java OOP concepts such as encapsulation, private fields, factory methods, and input validation.

## Features
- Create a bank account with a holder name and initial balance  
- Deposit money with validation  
- Withdraw money ensuring sufficient balance  
- Display current account balance  
- Continuous user interaction via a console menu  
- Input validation with graceful error handling  

## Learnings & Challenges
- **Encapsulation:** Used private fields and public getters/setters with validation to protect account data.  
- **Factory method:** Implemented a static factory method for controlled object creation.  
- **Input handling:** Learned how to use `Scanner` to interact with users via CLI.  
- **Exception handling:** Added `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle invalid menu inputs — this fixed the "variable might not have been initialized" compiler error and improved UX.  
- **Control flow:** Mastered looping menus and switch-case logic with Java 14+ arrow syntax.  

## Usage
Run the `BankApp` class and follow the on-screen prompts.
